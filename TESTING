The visual and amusement tests, included in this repository, do
not occur in dieharder or TestU01.  Dieharder and TestU01 are
statistical test suites.  To test erand with dieharder or TestU01,
feed the output from erandraw into those test suites.

------------------------------------------------------

Run qmatch to verify the period length of the erand
random number generator.  There is no parameter.

./qmatch

Press 'q' to quit.

The output of qmatch is the number of random number generator
cycles processed in billions of cycles, and the number of
matches of the current list of outputs to the original list
of outputs.  Each list of outputs, the original and the
current list, are placed in separate FIFO queues of 1024
outputs.  All 1024 outputs in each queue are compared until
a mismatch occurs, and then the next cycle is processed.
A match occurs when the erand random number generator wraps
around and repeats.  The period length of erand is the
factorial of 1024, or 5.41e+2639.  The two queues should
never match during the remaining life of the Universe.

------------------------------------------------------

Test erand by running tsterand.  There are no parameters.

./tsterand

The output from tsterand is a block of 1000 random zeros
and ones.

Time erand by running erandtim.  There are no parameters.

./erandtim

The output is a comparison between the performance of erand
and the GNU Scientific Library generator, taus2.  Taus2 is
listed as the fastest among the strong generators in the GSL.
100 million calls are made to each generator, and the
number of ticks consumed by each generator forms the basis
of comparison.

------------------------------------------------------

The Anderson-Darling test for a normal distribution is
included only as an example in this repository, because
it requires a statistical package, like R and the nortest
library.

To test erandnorm, run the script tstnorm.sh.

Usage:

./tstnorm.sh

Program erandnorm generates data in a normal distribution
using the Box-Muller transform.

The following is the syntax for program erandnorm.

Usage:

./erandnorm mean stdev size

Example:

./erandnorm 15.0 2.0 5000

The R package requires an upper limit of 5000 numbers
as input to a test.

------------------------------------------------------

Test erandint() by running erandpat.
This test requires the new curses package.

sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev

./erandpat

The output from erandpat is a random pattern of ASCII characters
on an 80x24 curses screen.  To quit press 'q'.

------------------------------------------------------

Test erandpwr() by running eranddots.
This test requires X Windows.

sudo apt-get install libx11-dev

./eranddots

The output from eranddots is a random bitmap pattern of pixels 
on an X Windows screen, 512x512.  To quit press 'q'.

This test also passes with the original Microsoft rand()
algorithm.

------------------------------------------------------

Random Walk Test:  ranwlk
This test requires X Windows.  See sudo apt-get above.

./tstwlk.sh

The output from tstwlk.sh is a random walk relative to a midpoint
line on an X Windows screen.  To quit press any key.

------------------------------------------------------

Captcha generator with random background and partially
random text colors.

Requires the Netpbm package.

Uses font.txt, a 12x24 font file.

------------------------------------------------------

Generate a stream of random DNA base pairs.
Display the DNA base pairs as parallel strands.

------------------------------------------------------

Random Powerball Simulation:  pwrball
pwrball is a random lottery game based on real odds
and real pay-outs.  The jackpot is $1 Billion.
This test requires new curses.  See apt-get above.

./pwrball

The output from pwrball shows money spent and money
received for each prize level.  To quit press 'q'.
The grand totals are in millions of dollars.
The lesser prizes are in thousands of dollars.

------------------------------------------------------

Use Microsoft's original rand() generator to deal a
deck of FreeCell cards by running fcdeal.

Usage:

fcdeal deal#

Where deal# is 1 to 1000000

Example:

fcdeal 617

The output is a tableau of 7 rows and 8 columns.
The first letter is the rank, Ace through King.
The second letter is the suit, Club, Diamond, Heart,
and Spade.

Using the erand algorithm with the Bays-Durham shuffle,
to deal cards, changes the order of cards, completely.
Only the original Microsoft algorithm matches the Windows
FreeCell program.

------------------------------------------------------

Dieharder Test:  tstdie.sh
Dieharder has to be installed first.

sudo apt-get install libdieharder-dev
sudo apt-get install dieharder

tstdie.sh illustrates how a raw stream of random data is piped
into a down stream test suite.

./tstdie.sh

The output from tstdie.sh is a statistical report.
This is a long running test.  To interrupt press CTRL-C.
The first test takes a half minute to print a report.

------------------------------------------------------

TestU01 is more difficult to run with the erand generator.
You have to download the TestU01 package and then compile it.
Then you have to write and compile a test program in the
examples directory of TestU01.  The short guide for TestU01
gives you examples of how to set up a test.  In particular,
you need to use ufile to read input from erandraw in your test.
After you get over the learning curve, you will be rewarded
with some strong and varied tests.

------------------------------------------------------

Test an encryption program using the erand random
number generator to encrypt data.

The following test does double encryption to obtain the
original stream of data.

Usage:

tstencr.sh filename password

Example:

tstencr.sh /vmlinuz abcdef

The output shows two identical md5sum strings.  The first
md5sum is before encrypting the data.  The second md5sum
is the result of double encryption.

----

Use an alpha text generator for testing the encryption.
The encryption algorithm is validated with two dieharder
tests.  The first test passes with encryption.  The second
test fails without encryption.

The following test proves that a non-random plain text file
can be enhanced with encryption to pass statistical
tests for randomness.

Usage:

tstdiee.sh alphabet password

Examples:

tstdiee.sh "abc" "defghi"
tstdiee.sh abc defghi

The output is a dieharder summary report.
It should show mostly successes with only a couple
of WEAK results.

This is a long running test.  Press CTL-C to interrupt it.

----

This test shows that a plain text stream of data fails
a battery of tests for randomness.

Usage:

tstdiea.sh alphabet

Examples:

tstdiee.sh "abc"
tstdiee.sh abc
tstdiee.sh abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
tstdiee.sh 0123456789

The output is a dieharder summary report.  It should show
almost all failures.

This is a long running test.  Press CTL-C to interrupt it.
